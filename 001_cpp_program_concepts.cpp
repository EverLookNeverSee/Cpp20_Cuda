     Names and keywords convention:
     1. A name can be any sequence of upper- or lowercase letters A to Z or a to z, the digits 0
        to 9, and the underscore character, _.
     2. A name must begin with either a letter or an underscore.
     3. Names are case sensitive.

     Other names that you are not supposed to use include the following:
     1. Names that begin with two consecutive underscores
     2. Names that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter
     3. Within the global namespace: all names that begin with an underscore

     Advice:
     Do not use names that start with an underscore.
